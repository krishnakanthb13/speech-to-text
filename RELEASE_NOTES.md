# 🚀 Release Notes - Handy-Groq STT

# 🚀 **v0.1.16 — Versioning, Accessibility & Web UX Overhaul**

This release focuses on **user accessibility, control, and developer ergonomics**. We've introduced a centralized config helper, custom API parameters (temperature), granular profile settings, and a fully polished, accessible Web UI.

### 🚀 New Features
- 🌗 **Light/Dark Theme Toggle (Web)**: Switch between dark glassmorphism and a clean, high-contrast light mode. Your choice is saved locally and loaded automatically on startup.
- ⏱️ **Live Duration Timer**: The desktop floating widget now displays real-time recording duration (e.g. `Listening (General) 2.4s`) to help you keep track of long recordings.
- 🔍 **History Search**: Real-time filtering of transcription history in the Web UI. Search by profile name, raw text, or refined text with high-performance client-side query matching.
- ⌨️ **Keyboard Accessibility Shortcuts**:
  * Press **`Space`** (when no input is focused) to instantly start/stop voice recording.
  * Dismiss open modals cleanly using the **`Escape`** key or **`Ctrl + C`** (only if no text is selected).
- 🌡️ **Temperature Slider**: Control output creativity/determinism (range `0.0`–`2.0`, defaulting to `0.7`) via CLI, Web UI slider, or `config.json`.
- ⚙️ **Per-Profile Refinement Toggle**: Toggle AI refinement (`refinement_enabled`) per profile, overriding the global setting. Enable/disable individually (e.g., the Simple profile skips LLM refinement by default).
- ℹ️ **Version Flag**: Check the running software version instantly using `python main.py --version`.

### ⚡ Improvements & Hardening
- 📁 **Centralized Configuration Manager**: Extracted all config operations into `config_utils.py`, providing atomic writes, automatic `.bak` backups, and JSONDecodeError auto-recovery.
- 🛡️ **Defensive State Handling**: Prevents `KeyError` crashes in both desktop and web backends if `config.json` is missing or empty, gracefully reverting to defaults.
- 🧹 **Port Cleanup**: Web launcher scripts automatically find and kill lingering zombie processes running on port `8091` to avoid startup bind errors.
- 🗑️ **Atomic History Search & Delete Sync**: Deleting items in the history modal updates the active memory cache (`allHistoryItems`), ensuring deleted items never reappear when search is activated.

# 🚀 **v0.1.12 — Stability, UX & Safety**

**AI personality persistence:** Personality sliders are now saved to `localStorage` and automatically restored on page load. Values are written whenever a slider changes, a preset is applied, or reset is clicked. Stored values are validated to ensure they are numbers between 0 and 100, and invalid or corrupted data safely falls back to defaults.

**AI personality indicator:** The AI Personality button now visually reflects when the personality has been customized. If any slider moves outside the default 40–60 range, the button gains an orange glow and border. The indicator updates in real time as sliders or presets change.

**Chat parameter validation:** The backend now strictly validates all personality parameters. Only the allowed keys (`humanRobot`, `factCreative`, `funnyRage`, `expertLame`, `formalSlang`) are accepted, and all values must be numbers between 0 and 100. Invalid requests are rejected with a 400 response and a descriptive error message.

**Crash-safe history deletion:** History deletion is now atomic and resilient to crashes. The server writes to a temporary file first and then uses an atomic rename to replace the original, ensuring history files can never be left in a partially written or corrupted state.

**Rate limiting:** Flask-Limiter has been added with a global limit of 15 requests per minute. The `/api/record` endpoint is explicitly protected with the same limit, using IP-based tracking via `get_remote_address` to prevent abuse and runaway clients.

## [v0.1.10] - THE PERSONALITY & UX UPDATE - 2026-01-28

This release focuses on **user experience** and **expression**. We've completely overhauled the Personality Engine to be more aggressive and impactful, while streamlining the Web UI for faster workflows.

### 🚀 New Features
- 🎭 **Aggressive AI Personalities**: The AI doesn't just "nudge" your text anymore—it transforms it. With our new prompt injection engine, selecting "Roast" or "Robot" will rewrite your transcript completely to match that persona.
- 📋 **Auto-Clipboard (Web)**: Transcription results are now automatically copied to your clipboard. Just hit `Ctrl+V`!
- 👻 **Smart History States**: Added playful "Ghost" empty states and new **"🎭 Custom" badges** in history logic to spot which recordings used specific personalities.

### ⚡ Improvements
- **💬 Direct Feedback**: Replaced intrusive "toast" notifications with clean, inline status messages (e.g., "Done! (Ctrl+V to paste)") that persist for 4 seconds.
- **📜 Smart Scrolling**: Added simple, native scrolling to the Prompt Display and Result areas for better readability of long texts.
- **🛡️ Robust Error Handling**: Added graceful fallbacks for history loading and network errors.

### 📚 Documentation
- **📖 Comprehensive Update**: Synced `README`, `CODE_DOCUMENTATION`, and `DESIGN_PHILOSOPHY` with the new "Aggressive Alignment" principle and Web UI features.
