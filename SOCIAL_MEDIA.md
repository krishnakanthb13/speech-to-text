**Title: Getting Aggressive with AI Expressions: Handy-Groq v0.1.10 🎭**

We just pushed a fascinating update to **Handy-Groq STT**.

When users asked for "Funny" or "Formal" modes, the AI sometimes played it too safe. In **v0.1.10**, we implemented an **Aggressive Prompt Engine**.

Now, if you ask for a "Roast", you don't just get a snarky comment—the AI completely rewrites your text into a full-blown roast. Same for "Robot Mode", "Gen-Z Slang", and more.

**New UX Features:**
*   📋 **Auto-Clipboard**: Web transcriptions are now instantly copied. Just talk and paste using `Ctrl+V`.
*   👻 **Smart UI**: Playful empty states and new "Custom Personality" badges in your history.
*   ⚡ **Direct Feedback**: Removed clutter (toasts) for cleaner, faster status updates.

1/5 🎭 THE PERSONALITY UPDATE! **Handy-Groq v0.1.10** is out, and it's got an attitude problem (in a good way).

We overhauled the Personality Engine. It’s no longer polite suggestions—it’s **Aggressive Instructions**. 😤

2/5 Select "Roast" mode? The AI will tear your transcript apart. 
Select "Robot"? You get cold, hard logic logs. 🤖
Select "Gen-Z"? No cap fr fr. 🧢

It completely rewrites your text based on the sliders you choose.

3/5 📋 **Auto-Clipboard**:
We killed the extra click. Transcriptions in the Web UI are now instantly copied to your clipboard. 

Recording -> Silence -> `Ctrl+V`. That's the flow. ⚡

4/5 👻 **UX Polish**:
- "Ghost" states for empty history.
- "Custom" badges for personality-tweaked clips.
- Native scrolling for long texts.

5/5 Get the update and try the new personalities:

**Title: [Showcase] I built Handy-Groq: A push-to-talk AI assistant that now lives in your system tray and supports macOS!**

Hey everyone! I just pushed a major update (**v0.1.0**) to **Handy-Groq STT**.

The goal was simple: I wanted a global hotkey that I could hold, talk to, and have the *perfect* version of that speech appear in my IDE or Email instantly.

**What's new:**
- Added a **System Tray Icon** (pystray) for better background management.
- Fully enabled **macOS support** for the interactive settings menu.
- Optimized the **Tkinter status pill** for high-DPI displays.
- Improved **Thread Safety** for more reliable long-term usage.

**Key Tech:**
- **Inference**: Whisper-large-v3-turbo + Llama-3.3-70b via Groq API.
- **UI**: Custom Tkinter canvas with high-DPI vector graphics.
- **Control**: `pynput` for global listeners.
- **OS**: Unified launchers for Windows (.bat) and Unix/macOS (.sh).

It’s completely free (GPL v3). I'm looking for feedback on more refined prompts for specific workflows!
